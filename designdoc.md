# Product Requirements Document: Story-to-Comic Generator (MVP)

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Final  
**Author:** AI Assistant & Project Lead  
**Date:** Sept 6, 2025  

## 1. Introduction & Vision

This document outlines the requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the "Story-to-Comic Generator" application. The core vision is to provide a simple, fully automated tool that allows users to transform their written stories into a visual comic or manga format with a single action. The user simply pastes their story, selects a style, and the app generates a sequence of comic pages for them to enjoy and share. This MVP will be built on a modern, scalable, and easy-to-manage serverless stack using AWS Amplify Gen 2 and will leverage the advanced image generation capabilities of Google's Gemini 2.5 model.

## 2. Target Audience & Goal

**Primary Users:** Readers and writers of short-form digital content, such as fanfiction (e.g., Wattpad readers), short stories (e.g., r/shortstories), or humorous anecdotes (e.g., 4chan greentext).

**User Goal:** To experience stories in a fun, unique, and visual new medium with minimal effort. The focus is on entertainment, speed, and novelty, not professional comic creation.

## 3. User Flow

The user experience is designed to be as streamlined as possible:

1. **Input:** The user lands on a single-page application with a simple text box. They paste their story into the box.
2. **Select Style:** The user chooses between two initial styles: "American Comic" or "Japanese Manga."
3. **Generate:** The user clicks a "Generate" button.
4. **Process:** The frontend immediately receives a unique Job ID and begins polling for status updates in the background. The UI will show a "Processing..." state.
5. **View & Download:** After a processing period, the generated comic pages appear in a simple web viewer. The user has an option to download all images as a series of JPGs.

## 4. Core Features & Scope (MVP)

This MVP is defined by its automation and simplicity. All steps in the content generation process will be handled by the backend system without user intervention.

### 4.1. Story Input
- A single, simple text area for users to paste their story.

### 4.2. Style Selection
- Two explicit style options: "American Comic" and "Japanese Manga."

### 4.3. Automated Backend Processing
- **Character Detection:** The system will automatically parse the story to identify main characters.
- **Character Consistency:** The system will generate a foundational design for each character to be referenced across all panels, ensuring visual consistency.
- **Story Chunking & Paneling:** The system will automatically break the story into logical chunks suitable for individual comic pages and decide on the panel layout for each page.
- **Prompt Generation:** For each panel, a detailed descriptive prompt (including characters, action, setting, and dialogue) will be generated for the image model.

### 4.4. Comic Page Generation
- The system will use the generated prompts to call the Google Gemini 2.5 API.
- The resulting panels will be composited into single page images (JPG).

### 4.5. Output & Delivery
- The final generated pages will be rendered as a series of JPG images.
- A simple web viewer will display the images in order.
- A "Download All" button will allow users to save the JPGs.

## 5. Out of Scope (Non-Goals for MVP)

- Any user editing or manual control (e.g., editing text, regenerating panels, changing layouts).
- Uploading reference images for characters or styles.
- More granular style selections.
- User accounts, saving projects, or a community platform.
- Support for structured script formats.

## 6. Success Metrics

- **Volume of Generations:** The number of stories successfully converted into comics per day.
- **Completion Rate:** The percentage of users who start a generation and view the final output.
- **Downloads:** The number of times the generated comic packs are downloaded.

## 7. Implementation Plan

The project will be built as a unified, full-stack application using AWS Amplify Gen 2, providing a Vercel-like developer experience on the AWS ecosystem. The entire application, from frontend to the asynchronous backend, will be defined as code within a single Next.js repository.

### 7.1. Technology Stack

- **Full Stack Application:** Next.js (React) hosted on AWS Amplify Gen 2.
- **AI Model:** Google Gemini 2.5 API.

### 7.2. Architecture

Simple synchronous architecture using Next.js on AWS Amplify Gen 2:

1. **Request:** User submits story and style via the frontend form.
2. **Process:** Next.js API route directly calls Google Gemini 2.5 API to:
   - Analyze the story and identify characters
   - Generate comic panel descriptions
   - Create comic page images
3. **Response:** Generated images are returned directly to the user for viewing and download.

### 7.3. Project Structure & Deployment

The entire project will live in a single GitHub repository.

```
/story-comic-app
|-- /src/                     <-- Next.js application
|   |-- /pages/
|   |   |-- index.tsx         <-- Main page with story input and results
|   |   |-- /api/generate.ts  <-- API route to generate comics
|-- package.json
|-- next.config.js
```

### 7.4. Deployment Workflow

1. **Local Development:** Run `npm run dev` for local development.
2. **Connect Git Repo:** Connect the GitHub repository to AWS Amplify Hosting.
3. **Deploy:** Push to the main branch. Amplify Gen 2 will automatically deploy the Next.js application.
