Victor eyed the timer: 01:00:00. "Plenty of time."
Kingston sighed. "That sentence always ages badly. We need to move."

They stared at the whiteboard. "Video, demo, write-up," Kingston said.
"So… everything," Victor said. "All of it," Kingston said. "Fast."

They opened the app. Victor pasted this story. "Going meta. Hitting Generate."
"Good. If it works on us, it works on anything," Kingston said.

Character refs appeared: Victor in a hoodie, Kingston with glasses.
"Hey, that's actually us," Victor said. "Lock these on every panel," Kingston said. "No face drift."

"Style pick?" Victor asked.
"Manga," Kingston said. "Decide once, stay consistent."

Layout spun up. Panel plan and bubbles drafted.
"Readable," Victor said. "Let it run."

Panels started streaming.
"Faces hold. Hair behaves," Victor said. "Finally," Kingston said.

One panel stalled.
"Panel six hiccup. Rerun it," Kingston said. "On it," Victor said. "Clean now."

"Download All," Victor said. "And the poster?"
"Create Shareable Image," Kingston clicked. Tiles snapped into a neat grid.

The timer flipped to 00:01:00.
"Plenty of time," Victor said.
"Submit before you jinx it," Kingston said.`,

小明看着倒计时：01:00:00。"时间还很充裕。"
小李叹了口气："这句话总是很快就被打脸。我们得抓紧了。"

他们盯着白板。"视频、演示、文档，"小李说。
"也就是说...全部，"小明说。"全部，"小李说。"而且要快。"

他们打开了应用。小明粘贴了这个故事。"开始元叙事。点击生成。"
"好，如果这个对我们有效，那对任何人都有效，"小李说。

角色参考图出现了：小明穿着连帽衫，小李戴着眼镜。
"嘿，这真的是我们，"小明说。"每个面板都锁定这些，"小李说。"不要让脸部漂移。"

"选什么风格？"小明问。
"漫画，"小李说。"决定一次，保持一致。"

布局开始运转。面板计划和对话框起草完成。
"可读性不错，"小明说。"让它运行。"

面板开始流式生成。
"脸部保持稳定。头发表现正常，"小明说。"终于，"小李说。

一个面板卡住了。
"第六个面板有问题。重新运行，"小李说。"正在处理，"小明说。"现在干净了。"

"下载全部，"小明说。"海报呢？"
"创建可分享图片，"小李点击。面板整齐地排列成网格。

计时器跳到了00:01:00。
"时间还很充裕，"小明说。
"在你说出不吉利的话之前赶紧提交，"小李说。`
